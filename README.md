# 🚀 LinkedIn Text Formatter Chrome Extension

**Formatting Text with Style — Without Markdown!**

---

When I noticed that LinkedIn doesn't support Markdown syntax like `**bold**` or `_italic_`, I decided to build something to solve it.  
So I created a custom Chrome extension that lets you format selected text using Unicode styles — directly inside any textarea, perfect for LinkedIn posts, messages, or comments.
